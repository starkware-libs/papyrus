//! Patricia hash tree implementation.
//!
//! Supports root hash calculation for Stark felt values, keyed by consecutive 64 bits numbers,
//! starting from 0.
//!
//! Each edge is marked with one or more bits.
//! The key of a node is the concatenation of the edges' marks in the path from the root to this
//! node.
//! The input keys are in the leaves, and each leaf is an input key.
//!
//! The edges coming out of an internal node with a key `K` are:
//! - If there are input keys that start with 'K0...' and 'K1...', then two edges come out, marked
//! with '0' and '1' bits.
//! - Otherwise, a single edge mark with 'Z' is coming out. 'Z' is the longest string, such that all
//! the input keys that start with 'K...' start with 'KZ...' as well. Note, the order of the input
//! keys in this implementation forces 'Z' to be a zeros string.
//!
//! Hash of a node depends on the number of edges coming out of it:
//! - A leaf: The hash is the input value of its key.
//! - A single edge: pedersen_hash(child_hash, edge_mark) + edge_length.
//! - '0' and '1' edges: pedersen_hash(zero_child_hash, one_child_hash).
