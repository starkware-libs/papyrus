## About

> Papyrus is a StarkNet full node written in Rust.

## Getting Started


### Compiling and running `papyrus`

Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

You can build and run a `papyrus` node with the default configuration by running:

```bash
cargo run --release --package papyrus_node --bin papyrus_node
```

### Configuration

`Papyrus` supports configuration from command-line arguments and a configuration yaml file.
In case both are provided, the command-line arguments take precedence.
The default path for the configuration file is `config/config.yaml`. You can override this path
using the `--config_file` command-line argument.
See the default [configuration file](config/config.yaml) for available options.
Note that the configuration file can be partial or even empty.
You can check the available command-line arguments by running:
```bash
cargo run --release --package papyrus_node --bin papyrus_node -- --help
```

## Running `papyrus` with Docker

Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

You can run a `papyrus` node with the default configuration by running:

```bash
docker run --rm --name papyrus\
  -p 8080-8081:8080-8081 \
  -v <local-host-data-path>:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/starkware-libs/papyrus:latest
```

Note:
* If you wish to run the most up-to-date code,
you can use the `ghcr.io/starkware-libs/papyrus:dev` image.
* Currently, there is no automatic upgrade mechanism.
Make sure to periodically pull the latest image and re-run the node.
