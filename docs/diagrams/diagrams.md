The diagrams in this directory describe specific flows or structures needed.

Unless otherwise noted, the syntax used is that of PlantUML (for various diagrams).

To view the diagrams (or embed somewhere), you can simply use plantuml online viewer, available
[here](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000).
Simply paste the diagram code from a file here into the text box, and see the resulting diagram.
You have links there to SVG/PNG versions as well.


You can also use the [VS-Code PlantUML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) (there are several options) to view and export diagrams if necessary.
